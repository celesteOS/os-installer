# This is an example config file for OS-Installer.
# Place your config under /etc/os-installer/config.yaml for it to be used.
# If a value is not defined, its default will be used.

# Some strings can have translations. Use the config_to_pot.py script to
# extract them into a .pot file, from which translations can be created.
# Place the translation .po files in /etc/os-installer/po/.

# Name of the distribution.

# After gathering all configured information, os-installer runs the scripts
# configured here. The installation can happen in up to three phases. A phase
# will be skipped if no script is configured for it.
#
# To see what is available per phase, see the examples scripts. If an "install"
# phase is configured, the installer behave slightly different:
# * A separate confirmation page is shown before user configuration happens
# * Navigating to pre-confirmation pages is not possible after confirmation
# * Language, desktop and disk choices can not be changed from the summary page
#
# If an internet connection is required, it will be available for all phases.
#
# prepare   - Run directly or when an internet connection is available.
# install   - Run with locale, disk and optional desktop configured.
# configure - Run with everything configured.
