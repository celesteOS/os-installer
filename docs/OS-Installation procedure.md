    2. Setup user and configure system

## Step 1: Installation
    ### Requirements
        * internet connection
            * Requires abilitiy to configure WiFi
                * Requires interface language
                * Requires keyboard layout for password
        * disk space
            * Requires Selection of disk / partition
                * Benefits from language for help / confirmation
            * Potentially requires partitioning
                * Requires interface language

    Thus the resulting steps are:
        1. Establish interface language
            * Enables non-graphical communication with user
        2. Set keyboard layout
            * Enables user input
        3. Setup internet connection
        4. Set disk / partition to use
            * Show confirmation dialog to avoid undesired hard drive changes
    
    Afterwards installation can run in background and step 2 can be prepared.

## Step 2: Configuration
    ### Requirements
        * user name
        * password
        * auto-login vs encryption
        * locale

    These can be queried in any order and applied after installation has finished.
